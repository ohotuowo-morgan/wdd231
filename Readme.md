- Build, test, and present small frontend projects

## Learning Outcomes
By course end students will be able to:
- Create accessible, well-structured web pages
- Implement responsive designs that work across devices
- Manipulate the DOM and handle events with JavaScript
- Debug and optimize frontend code flow and performance
- Collaborate using Git and GitHub workflows
